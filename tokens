################################### Character Set Of Python Language.... ##################################################################################

  --> In C-Language their are --> 256 Characters in ASCII (American standard code for information interchange)
  --> In python language --> 65536 Characters in ASCII unicode for Encode/Decode.

        ASCII: -->It contains only letters in English.
        Unicode: -->It contains any type of language.

  -->Python is a universal language it supports characters of different language.

    --> python uses two encoding standards:-

            1. ASCII.
            2. Unicode.

        -->Python Programming can be written using "65536" characters.

Token :
    

      1.	Keywords (33)
      2.	Identifiers
      3.	Literals
      4.	Operators
      5.	Data types.

      

      Keyword belongs to valve : True, Flase, None
      Keyword belongs to control statements : if, ifelse, else, while, for, break, continue, pass, return
      Keyword belongs to functions and modules: def, with, as, import, from, global, local, yield, lambda 
      Keywords to operators: And, or, not, is, in, del  
      Keyword belongs to classes: class
      Keyword belongs to error/exception handing: try, except, finally, raise, assert


      Identifiers:
                  
                It is user defined words.
                  --> Identifiers is the name given to entities like class, functions variables and etc.,
                  -->It helps differentiating one entity from another.
                  -->Identifiers is a collection of aplhabets, digits and allows one special characters.

              Rules for writing identifiers:
                -->Identifiers can be combination of letters in lower case (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_).
                -->Name like myclass,var_1 and print_this_to-screen all are valid example.
                -->An identifiers cannot start with a digits-1 varibales is invalid but variable 1 is perfectly fine.
                -->keywords are cannot be used as identifiers. 

      Literals:

                Syntaxical representation of a value / constant.

                -->Python allows to represent integer values in 4 formats..
                      1. Decimal Integers.
                      2. Octal Integers.
                      3. Hexa Decimal Integers.
                      4. Binary Integers.


            Decimal Integers.:
                  --> An integer values with base 10 is called decimal integers.
                  --> This integers consists of digits from 0 to 9.
                  --> This integers prefix with (+) or (-).
                  --> It does not allows any special characters.

            Octal Integers:
                  --> An integer values with base 8 is called as Octal integer.
                  --> This integers consists of digits from 0 to 7.
                  --> This integers prefix with 0o.

            Hexa Decimal Integers:
                  --> An integer values with base 16 is called hexa decimal integers.
                  --> This integers consists of digits from 0 to 9 and a-f.
                  --> This integers is prefix with 0x/ox.

            Binary Integers:
                  --> An integer value with base 2 is called binary integers.
                  --> This integers consists of 0's and 1's.
                  --> This integers prefix with 0b and 0B.



      Operators:
              -->Operators is a special symbol which performs some operations.
              -->Each operators in python is bind with a function/method.
              -->python operators are characterised in different forms.
                          1.Arthimetic operators.
                          2.Relational operators.
                          3.Logical operators.
                          4.Assignment operators.
                          5.Bitwise operators.
                          6.membership operators.
                          7.Identity operators. 
            
              

      Data types:
        
            1.  Standard data types: int, float, complex, bool, none  it holds only single value.
            2.  Collection data types: list, tuple, set, frozenset, dicitionary, string, range it holds sequential values.


--> Mutable:- after creating object whose value are changed.
--> Immutable :- it can’t modify but shared
