Tuples:

      --> Tuples are immutable sequence typically used to store collections.
      --> symbol is ().
      --> seperated items with commas a,b,c or (a,b,c)
      --> it is a ordered collections..



what is the difference between list and tuples:

    1. list --> mutable
       tuple -->immutable.

    2. --> after creating a list we can add, remove,or update items.
       --> after creating a tuple we cannot perform any operations.
      
    3. --> both are index based.

    4. --> both are ordered collections.

--> you can create list in a tuple or vice vers.

    example:

            list1=[(10,20,30),(40,50,60)]
                    or
            tuple1=([10,20,30],[40,50,60])

--> tuples comprehension has can't be done as like as list.
