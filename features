  1. Easy:
      --> Python is Easy to code compared to other popular languages like JAVA snd C++ easier to code in python.
      --> Python is Easy to read being a "high level languages " it's just like English.
  
  2. Expressive:
      --> It is more understandable and Readable.
  
  3. Free and Open source:
      -->Firstly python is Freely available you can download it from the fallowing link 
              https://www.python.org./download
      -->Secondly it is open source this means that its source code is available to the public.
      --> You can download and distrubute anywere this is called FLOSS/FREE/LIBRE and "open source software".
  
  4. High-level :
      --> It is High level languages independent to hardware.
  
  5. Portable:
      --> your code is runs on any type of machine then it is no need to write different codes for different machines.
 
  6. Object Oriented:
      -->Python is a Object Oriented languages but Object Oriented is not a language.
      --> Object Oriented is programming paradigm (set of rules and regulations).
      --> Every object having 2 properties:- 
                                            1. properties.
                                            2. state.

      --> principles:- 
                      1. Encapsulation. --> grouping of data.
                      2. Polymersim. --> it controls parent class object from child class object.
                      3. Inheritence.  --> multiple class accessing.

  7. Extensible:
        -->you can write your python code in another languages.
  
  8. Embeddable:
        -->your python code in another languages. 
  
  9. Interpreted:
        -->In interpreter your source code is executed line by line.
          
          Translator:
                There are 2 types of Translators are they :-
                          1. Interpreter. --> line by line translates.
                          2. Compiler.  --> it transalate our whole program.
  
  10. Large Standard library:
        --> library: set of Predefined programs.
        
        --> one of the reason pyhton is more popular.
        
        -->source code:
                 The code  which written in High level languages  then it is known as "source code".
  
  11. GUI programming:
          -->Graphical user interface can be can be developed by python.
  
  12. Dynamically Typed:
          -->Python is Dynamically Typed language.(run time).
          -->The C, C++, JAVA, and .NET are statically typed languages. These languages uses data types inoder to create variables.
          -->Types of variables known before Execution of program.
          --> In Python variables are creates without Explicity defining datatypes. Types of varibales is known as Runtime based on the value assigned.
          -->Variables in pyhton are polymerphic whose behaviour changes based on type of values assigned.
