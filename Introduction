Python Defination:

          --> python is "HIGH LEVEL", "MULTIPARADIGM" and "GENERAL PURPOSE" programming language.

--> Python has  supported 2 types of languages:-
        1. programming languages --> like as C, C++, Java --> it develops any software applications.
        2. Scripting languages --> A Small program Execued in another program script cannot Executed Individually.

  1. Programming languages :

    --> A language software Which provide set of instructions in order to develops Applications/software.
    --> And it is high level language.
    --> basically there are 2 types of level languages.

          1. high level language --> Portable. --> hardware independent
          2. low level language  --> non-portable  --> dependent to hardware.
      note:

          --> processor are "machine level language".
          --> Inorder to translate by using compiler / Interpreter high level language to "machine level language / low level language / Assembly level languge.


    Program:

         --> It is set of data instructions fallowed by some rules.

    Python Programming:
        
          It is mainly based on 
            1. OOP (object oriented programming) --> Java 
            2. POP (procedural oriented programming) --> C
            3. FOP (Functional Oriented Programming)


     
  2. Scripting languages:

       --> It is a small program Executed with in another program script cannot executed Individually.
       --> Python is also always server side.

MULTIPARADIGM:

 --> Python is MULTIPARADIGM  programming languages and it is defined as set of rules and regulations inoder to regulation inorder to organise data and instructions.
     
GENERAL PURPOSE:

      --> Python is GENERAL PURPOSE programming languages.

                  A programming languages used to develop any type of Applications or software is called as GENERAL PURPOSE programming languages.
             
   #################################################........PYTHON IDE'S ................................#################################################################
  
  Python IDE's:

      --> While writing Python code integrating modules and libraries to build large systems a simple that editor is not enough.
      -->We need a good integrated development environment for that.

      Pycharm:

            --> Created by jetbrains.
            --> Closed source.
            --> windows MACOS and Linux support.
            --> Designed for Python, JAVA Script, HTML / CSS, Angular IS node.JS and more.
            --> Features integrated unit testing code inspection, integrated version control. 
            --> Code refactoring tools. A variety of tools for project navigation, highlightening and automated completion.
            --> Supports multiple third party web development frameworks like Django, Pyramid, web2py, googleapp, engine and flask which makes it a complete rapid app device IDE.

      SPYDER:
       
            --> Open Source IDE for Python.
            --> Avaliable as free to use under MIT License.
            --> Some of the basic features of spyder python are multi language editor, Interactive console, documentation, viewer, variable explorer, find in files file explorer etc.


      PYTHON-IDLE:

            --> An IDE that is part of Python standard library.
            --> It is Quite helpful to try out small python snippets and experiment with different features in python.

      PYTHON-Distributions:

            NOTE: 
                   PIP: It is Python Package it is used to the Install/Uninstall the Packages.

            --> A Python distribution is a software bundle which contain a python interpreter and the python standard library.
            --> Installer programs for common operating system are a frequent mode of distribution.
            --> Many Python distribution also have package managers so that you can install or upgrade varibales python packages.

                Example:-   Anaconda --> Distributions.
                
   ################################################...... How to Install Python Software...........########################################################

Python Software:

        1. python software can be downloaded from
                        " https:\\www.python.org\download ".

        2. Click on version of the software " ex:- download 3.4 ".
        3. Just remember Install/download location.

    PIP:- It is Package Management tool that means python libraries.



################################################......Python Programming Languages...........########################################################

      --> Python has mainly 2 basic modes.

                1. Scripting modes.
                2. Interactive modes.

      --> This normal modes is the mode where the scripted and finished with .py files are run in the python interpreter.
      --> Interactive mode is a command line shell which gives immediate  feedback for each statement while running previously fed statements in active memory.

Interactive modes:

    How to work with Interactive mode.....? :
      --> Execute " python " from command prompt to run python interactive shell.
      --> Python prompt is made up of three greater than symbols. ANd it is valid Expressions can now be Evaluted interactivally.
      --> It is called Chevron Prompt.

    How to Quite the Python shell...? :
      --> To end the interactive sessions.
      --> You can either use Exit () to exit. The brackets behind the exit function are crucial.
      --> ( waarning:-  Exit without brackets works in python 2-x but doesn't works anymore in python 3-x).


    How to compile python Program...? :
        --> In command prompt..
        --> address of the file where its is exists then <filename.py> 
        --> orelse python-m py_compile <filename>
        -->There will be a new sub directory " __ pychache__". If it hasn't already existed.
        -->you will find the file " filename.pyc", in this sub directory.
        --> This is the compiled version of our file in bytes code.
                .py --> source file.
                .pyc -->compiled file.
              note: -m --> module include.
        -->At interactive mode:-
                --> import py_compile
                --> py_compile.compile("filename")

What is PATH....? :
      --> It is a Operating System creating Environment (Temporarly).
      --> Path is a Operating system Environment variable Which is used to set the location where python command is available.

Scripting modes:

        --> Open any text editor and source file with extension file as .py
        --> Open command prompt and type the fallowing command   python <filename>

    Python Internals:

        --> Python is both an interpreter and an compiled languages.
        -->Python code is transalated in to intermediate code, which has to be Executed by a virtual machine. 
        Known as the python virtual machine this is a similar approch to the taken by java.
        --> There is even away of Translating python programs in to Java byte code for the Java. Virtual machine (JVM this can be Archevied by Jython.
