Python Defination:

          --> python is "HIGH LEVEL", "MULTIPARADIGM" and "GENERAL PURPOSE" programming language.

--> Python has  supported 2 types of languages:-
        1. programming languages --> like as C, C++, Java --> it develops any software applications.
        2. Scripting languages --> A Small program Execued in another program script cannot Executed Individually.

  1. Programming languages :

    --> A language software Which provide set of instructions in order to develops Applications/software.
    --> And it is high level language.
    --> basically there are 2 types of level languages.

          1. high level language --> Portable. --> hardware independent
          2. low level language  --> non-portable  --> dependent to hardware.
      note:

          --> processor are "machine level language".
          --> Inorder to translate by using compiler / Interpreter high level language to "machine level language / low level language / Assembly level languge.


    Program:

         --> It is set of data instructions fallowed by some rules.

    Python Programming:
        
          It is mainly based on 
            1. OOP (object oriented programming) --> Java 
            2. POP (procedural oriented programming) --> C
            3. FOP (Functional Oriented Programming)


     
  2. Scripting languages:

       --> It is a small program Executed with in another program script cannot executed Individually.
       --> Python is also always server side.

MULTIPARADIGM:

 --> Python is MULTIPARADIGM  programming languages and it is defined as set of rules and regulations inoder to regulation inorder to organise data and instructions.
     
GENERAL PURPOSE:

      --> Python is GENERAL PURPOSE programming languages.

                  A programming languages used to develop any type of Applications or software is called as GENERAL PURPOSE programming languages.
